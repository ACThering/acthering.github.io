<h2 id="decide">Fix or rebuild: choosing the most effective path</h2>
<p>For images, accessibility remediation often starts with a decision. In many cases, replacing an image with accessible text, a simple table, or a redesigned visual is more effective than attempting to describe a complex or low-quality image. The goal is not to preserve the original image at all costs but to ensure learners can access the instructional meaning.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix the image use when it is instructionally meaningful, visually clear, and can be described accurately with alt text or a long description.</li>
<li>Rebuild or replace when the image contains dense text, low-resolution content, complex charts without underlying data, or decorative styling that obscures meaning.</li>
</ul>

<!-- DECORATIVE VS INFORMATIVE -->
<section class="card" aria-labelledby="decorative-title">
<h2 id="decorative-title">Decorative images: choosing the right approach</h2>
<p>Not every image needs alt text. Images that do not convey instructional meaning should be marked as decorative so they are skipped by screen readers.</p>
<p><strong>Mark as decorative</strong> when the image does not convey instructional meaning. The image can be removed without affecting what students are expected to learn.</p>
<p><strong>Write alt text</strong> when the image communicates essential information that can be conveyed accurately in one or two sentences.</p>
<p><strong>Provide a long description</strong> when the image is complex and cannot be adequately described in one or two sentences, such as charts, diagrams, or multi-part visuals.</p>

<details>
<summary>Common examples</summary>
<ul>
<li><strong>Decorative:</strong> Stock photo banner used for visual interest only</li>
<li><strong>Decorative:</strong> Icon that repeats adjacent text (for example, a calendar icon next to a due date)</li>
<li><strong>Alt text:</strong> Screenshot that shows where to click to submit an assignment</li>
<li><strong>Long description:</strong> Multi-part diagram or infographic where relationships and labels matter</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Common pitfalls</summary>
<ul>
<li>Adding alt text to decorative images, which creates unnecessary repetition and distraction for screen reader users</li>
<li>Marking an image as decorative when students are expected to interpret it</li>
<li>Using long descriptions for simple images that can be described in one sentence</li>
</ul>

<!-- ALT TEXT -->
<section class="card" aria-labelledby="alt-title">
<h2 id="alt-title">Alt text for images</h2>
<p>Typical uses include photos, diagrams, screenshots, icons that convey meaning, and instructional images embedded in Brightspace pages or documents.</p>
<details>
<summary>How to upload and use the prompts (Alt text)</summary>
<ol>
<li>Use an institutionally approved AI tool when working with university or student-related content.</li>
<li>Prepare the image and remove student identifiers. If the image includes student names, grades, or personal information, do not upload it.</li>
<li>Provide the image in one of these ways:
<ul>
<li>Upload the image file if file upload is available.</li>
<li>If upload is not available, paste a description of the image and any visible text.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Provide one sentence of context that explains the purpose of including the image in the course and who the audience is.</li>
<li>Paste one prompt from the prompt bank below.</li>
<li>Review the result and revise as needed to match instructional intent and course terminology.</li>
<li>Enter the final alt text in the tool where the image is posted. Validate in Brightspace.</li>

<summary>Prompt bank (Alt text)</summary>
<p class="badge info">Label: purpose based alt text</p>
<h3>Prompt A. Purpose based alt text draft</h3>
<pre><code>You may be receiving an uploaded image, or you may only receive a pasted description of the image.

First, ask me to provide:
1) The instructional purpose of including this image in the course
2) What the image is meant to teach or demonstrate
3) Who the intended audience is
4) Any text that appears in the image that must be conveyed

If you have enough information, draft concise, purpose based alt text in 1 to 2 sentences.
Include only essential information needed to achieve the instructional purpose.
Avoid phrases such as "image of" or "picture of" unless needed for clarity.
If the image appears decorative, recommend marking it as decorative instead of writing alt text.

Return the alt text only.</code></pre>
<h3>Prompt B. Decorative or informative decision support</h3>
<pre><code>You may be receiving an uploaded image, or you may only receive a pasted description of the image.

Based on the image and the course context I provide, determine whether the image is:
1) Informative and requires alt text
2) Decorative and should be marked as decorative

If informative, draft 1 to 2 sentences of alt text.
If decorative, state "Mark as decorative" and provide one short rationale.

Return the recommendation and the alt text if applicable.</code></pre>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Manual remediation checklist for Alt text</summary>
<ul>
<li>Confirm whether the image is decorative or informative using the decision guide above.</li>
<li>For informative images, write alt text that communicates the instructional purpose, not just visual appearance.</li>
<li>Keep alt text concise and focused on essential meaning.</li>
<li>Include visible text only when it is instructionally necessary.</li>
<li>Avoid duplicating surrounding page text in the alt text.</li>
<li>For complex visuals, use a long description in addition to alt text.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Validation for Alt text</summary>
<ul>
<li>Confirm the image has alt text or is marked as decorative in the authoring tool.</li>
<li>Run the Ally Course Report for Brightspace pages that include images.</li>
<li>Spot check with a screen reader to confirm the alt text is read appropriately and in context.</li>
</ul>
<p class="badge time">Typical time: 2 to 10 minutes per image</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Common pitfalls in Alt text</summary>
<ul>
<li>Alt text describes appearance but not instructional meaning.</li>
<li>Alt text is too long and includes unnecessary detail.</li>
<li>Decorative images have alt text, creating noise for screen reader users.</li>
<li>Images contain text that should be replaced with real text on the page when possible.</li>
</ul>
</details>
</section>
<!-- LONG DESCRIPTIONS -->
<section class="card" aria-labelledby="long-title">
<h2 id="long-title">Long descriptions for complex images</h2>
<p>Use long descriptions for charts, graphs, infographics, process diagrams, maps, and complex visuals where 1 to 2 sentences cannot convey the instructional meaning.</p>
<details>
<summary>How to upload and use the prompts (Long descriptions)</summary>
<ol>
<li>Use an institutionally approved AI tool and remove student identifiers.</li>
<li>Provide the image by uploading it or by pasting a detailed description of what it contains, including any labels and visible text.</li>
<li>Provide context that explains the instructional purpose of the image and what students should learn from it.</li>
<li>If the image is a chart or graph, provide the underlying data if available. If data is not available, provide the best available description of axes, legend, and key values.</li>
<li>Paste one prompt from the prompt bank below.</li>
<li>Review the output for accuracy and revise as needed.</li>
<li>Post the long description near the image in Brightspace, using clear labeling such as "Long description" or "Text alternative."</li>
</ol>
</details>

<summary>Prompt bank (Long descriptions)</summary>
<p class="badge info">Label: text alternatives for complex visuals</p>
<h3>Prompt A. Long description draft</h3>
<pre><code>You may be receiving an uploaded complex image, or you may only receive a pasted description of the image.

First, ask me to provide:
1) The instructional purpose of this image
2) What it is meant to teach or demonstrate
3) Who the intended audience is
4) Any visible text, labels, axes, or legend items that must be conveyed
5) If it is a chart, any data values available

Then write:
1) Alt text in 1 to 2 sentences that identifies the image type and main point
2) A long description that stands alone and communicates the essential information

Long description requirements:
- Begin with a 1 to 2 sentence overview
- Follow with an objective description of 4 to 8 sentences
- Describe structure, relationships, sequence, and key values or trends
- Include readable versions of any text in the image that is required for meaning
- Avoid interpreting conclusions that are not directly supported by the image

Return the alt text and long description only.</code></pre>
<h3>Prompt B. Chart or graph text alternative with data table recommendation</h3>
<pre><code>You may be receiving an uploaded chart or graph, or you may only receive a pasted description.

If the underlying data is available, recommend whether a simple data table should be posted in Brightspace as a companion text alternative.
If no data is available, recommend what data would be needed to create a table.

Then draft:
1) Alt text in 1 to 2 sentences
2) A long description in 4 to 8 sentences focused on key trends and values

Return the recommendation, alt text, and long description.</code></pre>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Manual remediation checklist for Long descriptions</summary>
<ul>
<li>Confirm whether a long description is needed. If the image is complex, 1 to 2 sentences are not sufficient.</li>
<li>Ensure the long description communicates structure and relationships, not decorative styling.</li>
<li>For charts and graphs, consider providing a data table or a short summary of key values.</li>
<li>Place the long description near the image and label it clearly.</li>
<li>Ensure the long description does not repeat surrounding text verbatim unless needed for meaning.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Validation for Long descriptions</summary>
<ul>
<li>Confirm the image has alt text and that the long description is discoverable near the image.</li>
<li>Run the Ally Course Report for the page where the image is posted.</li>
<li>Spot check with a screen reader to confirm that users can reach the long description easily.</li>
</ul>
<p class="badge time">Typical time: 10 to 30 minutes per complex image</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Common pitfalls in Long descriptions</summary>
<ul>
<li>Long descriptions are missing labels, axes, or legend information.</li>
<li>Descriptions include interpretation not supported by the image.</li>
<li>Descriptions are posted far from the image or without a clear label.</li>
<li>Charts are presented without underlying data or a usable text alternative.</li>
</ul>
